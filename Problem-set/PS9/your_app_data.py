# Fill in the credentials you get from registering a new application. (Regenerate them AFTER you get the grade for this assignment.)
APP_ID     = '3138648619528198'
APP_SECRET = '7a88c26fe20d2b2a76c53f1953560b07'

# To get an App ID and App Secret, you will need to register for a new Facebook application at https://developers.facebook.com. To do this:
#   1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com
#   2. Create a new app
#       - There should be a 'Get Started' button if you've never created an app with Facebook integration
#       - If you've previously created an app, you should be able to go to My Apps > Add a New App
#   3. Choose an App display name (e.g., My SI 506 App)
#   4. Add the 'Facebook Login' product to your app
#       - The 'Select a Product' page should come up after Step 3, but you can also add a product using the '+ Add Product' button in the left panel
#   5. Don't do the Quick Start; just go to click Settings (under Facebook Login) in the left panel
#   6. In the 'Valid OAuth Redirect URIs' field on the 'Client OAuth Settings' page, enter the following URL:
#       https://www.programsinformationpeople.org/runestone/oauth
#   7. Save Changes
#
#   Now you can find your App ID and App Secret on the 'Dashboard' page (see left panel).
