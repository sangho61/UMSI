Beneath the snow and a thin crust of ice, you could poke through to water. But below that was a big thick layer of ice. I crossed on Sunday with Max and one of his friends.\n\nInspired by that, two days this week, I strapped on x-country skis, skied up river on the ice, under the railroad bridge and into the Arboretum.  I carried my skis once I reached campus. Felt very Canadian, or perhaps Norwegian, skiing to work.",
