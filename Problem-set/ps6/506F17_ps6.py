## [PROBLEM 1]
print("\n*** PROBLEM 1 ***\n") # Print statements like this are to help you separate
#out the parts of the file that pertain to different problems in the problem set. You should leave them alone.
#------

## You should also have downloaded a file called nested_data_ps6.json.
##Use Python file operations and the json.loads function to save the data from that file,
##in a Python dictionary, to a variable called file_diction.

## Write your code to do so here.

f= open("nested_data_ps6.json", "r")
file_diction = json.loads(f.read())
f.close()



## [PROBLEM 2]
print("\n*** PROBLEM 2 ***\n")

## We've provided some code below that creates a pretty complicated Python dictionary and saves it to a variable python_diction.

python_diction = {}
python_diction["items"] = []
python_diction["items"].append({"hello":1,"hi":2})
python_diction["items"].append({"hello":42,"hi":65})
python_diction["numbers"] = [1,2,3,5,7,8]

## Write Python code that uses the json.dumps function and Python file operations to write the data in the python_diction variable to a file called python_diction_saved.json.
python_diction_saved = json.dumps(python_diction)


## Write your code to do so here.



#######

## NOTE: the rest of the problems in this Problem Set use the Federal Aviation Administration API,
# just like your reading in the APIs chapter of the textbook does. Note that these questions build on one another,
# so your answer to one will help you with problems later on!


## [PROBLEM 3] Encoding query parameters in a URL and making a request to an API, in several parts.
print("\n*** PROBLEM 3 ***\n")

## Create a dictionary to hold the FAA query parameters. It should be called called url_parameters.
## You can do this in 2 lines of code (or even just one), just like dictionary creation you did earlier in the course!
## You should end up with a dictionary saved in the variable url_parameters with one key, "format",
# and its associated value should be a string, "json".

url_parameters = {}
url_parameters["format"] = "json"


## Then write the assignment statement that makes a request to the FAA API and saves the result in a variable called airport_response.
## We've provided some code for you to rely on here (you could also refer to the textbook or FAA API documentation to decide that you needed this).
baseurl = 'http://services.faa.gov/airport/status/'
airport = 'DTW'
airport_response = requests.get(baseurl+airport, params=url_parameters)

## Remember, you'll need to concatenate the airport code string ``"DTW"`` to the base url,
# and pass that as well as the ``url_parameters`` dictionary you already created to the ``requests.get`` function.
# Save the result in the variable airport_response.
## You can do this part in 1 line of code.


## Finally, save the URL associated with the request you just made to a variable called airport_dtw_url.
# Do not hard code this by typing out the URL again.
## HINT: response objects have a .url attribute...
airport_dtw_url = airport_response.url



## [PROBLEM 4] Grabbing data off the web
print("\n*** PROBLEM 4 ***\n")

## Use the appropriate json module function and the attributes of a response object in order to
# write code to get the data from inside the airport_response variable into a Python dictionary called airport_data.


## Then, write Python code to save a LIST of the KEYS in the airport_data dictionary to a variable called airport_data_keys.
## Remember that you'll need to cast the result of .keys() to a list in Python 3!

airport_data = json.loads(airport_response.text)
airport_data_keys = airport_data.keys()


## [PROBLEM 5] Extracting relevant information from a dictionary
print("\n*** PROBLEM 5 ***\n")

## Write code to extract the following information from the airport_data dictionary: the airport code (e.g. DTW),
# the value of the 'reason' field from within the airport status, the current temperature at that airport,
# and the last time the data was updated. Save these pieces of info in variables called,
# respectively: airport_code, status_reason, current_temp, recent_update.

## You CAN do this in one line of code, but it may be easier to do this in 4 lines of code.
## HINT: jsoneditoronline.org and Understand/Extract/Repeat will be helpful here!

airport_code = airport_data['IATA']
status_reason = airport_data['status']['reason']
current_temp = airport_data['weather']['temp']
recent_update= airport_data['weather']['meta']['updated']


## Uncomment the following lines if you want to see the printed reps of what's in these variables.
print(airport_code)
print(status_reason)
print(current_temp)
print(recent_update)


## [PROBLEM 6] Generalizing your code
print("\n*** PROBLEM 6 ***\n")

## At this point, you'll consider the code you've written so far in your file, and make it generalizable. Which means... defining a function.

## Define a function called get_airport() that accepts a three-letter airport code string as input to the function,
# and returns a Python dictionary (like the one you saved in airport_data above) with data about that airport.

## This function should work no matter where it is called, with just the input of an airport code like "DTW" or "PDX" or "LAX", etc.
# It should NOT depend upon global variables. (So, if a programmer like you input "DTW" into your get_airport function,
# you should get a different result returned than from invoking the function with the input "LAX", and so on.)

## You can assume that the requests module is available at the top of your file,
# though (you do not have to import it again in your function definition of get_airport).

## Note: You should NOT put any try/except clauses inside this function.

## Define your get_airport() function below.

def get_airport(airport):
    url_parameters = {}
    url_parameters["format"] = "json"
    airport_response = requests.get(baseurl+airport, params=url_parameters)
    airport_data = json.loads(airport_response.text)
    return airport_data

print(get_airport("DTW"))
print(get_airport("LAX"))

## [PROBLEM 7] More code generalization
print("\n*** PROBLEM 7 ***\n")

## Now, write another function called extract_airport_data() that accepts an airport code string as input,
# like "LAX", and returns a tuple: of the airport code, status reason, current temp, and recent update.
## This function should invoke the get_airport() function from problem 6 inside it.
## HINT: What you did for problem 5 may be helpful here!

def extract_airport_data(code):
    airport_data = get_airport(code)
    a = (airport_data['IATA'], airport_data['status']['reason'], airport_data['weather']['temp'], airport_data['weather']['meta']['updated'])
    return a

print(extract_airport_data("PHX"))

## [PROBLEM 8] Examples of using your newly defined functions with real data
print("\n*** PROBLEM 8 ***\n")

fav_airports = ['PIT', 'BOS', 'LGA', 'DCA']

## Write code here to iterate over the fav_airports list, invoke your extract_airport_data function on each element of the list,
# and append all of the results to a new list in a variable airport_tuples.
## The airport_tuples variable should end up being a list of 4 tuples, each of which contains information about a different airport.
airport_tuples = []
for i in fav_airports:
    airport_tuples.append(extract_airport_data(i))

## [PROBLEM 9] Dealing with real live data
print("\n*** PROBLEM 9 ***\n")

possible_airports = ["LAX","PHX","PPT","BOS","JAC","PDX","DTW"]

## Write code to iterate over the list in possible_airports and invoke the extract_airport_data function on each element of the list,
# appending each result to a list called poss_airport_tuples, similar to Problem 8.

## HOWEVER, your code should include a try/except clause such that if any element
# in the possible_airports list is NOT a valid airport to invoke the function on, your code should NOT create an error,
# just print out "Sorry, [whatever airport code] didn't work."

## For example, if the string "XYZ" were in the list, you should see: "Sorry, XYZ didn't work." in the console,
# and all the valid data should still be accumulated into the list poss_airport_tuples.
poss_airport_tuples = []

for i in possible_airports:
    try:
        poss_airport_tuples.append(extract_airport_data(i))
    except:
        print("Sorry, " + i + " didn't work.")



## [PROBLEM 10] Using real live data to write a CSV file
print("\n*** PROBLEM 10 ***\n")


## Now, you'll iterate over the fav_airports list again, but you'll write the data to a CSV file.

## Iterate over the list fav_airports from Problem 8 again, but this time,
# write code to write to a CSV file called airport_temps.csv with 4 columns: airport_code, status_reason, current_temp, recent_update.

## Your resulting CSV file should have at least 5 lines: 4 lines for real airport data, and 1 line for the column headers.
# The content of each cell should have well-formatted data: no extra parentheses, just the specific value that corresponds to that header!


##MAKE SURE THE CSV FILE YOU CREATE IS CALLED EXACTLY airport_temps.csv. We will run tests on the CSV files post-submission,
# and we depend on the name of the file being correct.
## Open the document in Excel or in Google Drive to make sure that it is properly formatted.
## Since you are iterating over fav_airports in this problem, not possible_airports,
# you probably do not need to use a try/except clause in THIS problem if you do all the ones it relies upon correctly!

## Write the code to write your CSV file airport_temps.csv here:
f = open("airport_temps.csv", "w")
f.write("airport_code, status_reason, current_temp, recent_update\n")
for i in fav_airports:
    f.write("{}, {}, {}, {}\n".format(*extract_airport_data(i)))
f.close()

## When you're finished, upload your 506W17_ps6.py file to Canvas. Please DO NOT upload the files that your code generates --
# your code should generate them when we run it!
## Remember that we do not grade files that do not run.
